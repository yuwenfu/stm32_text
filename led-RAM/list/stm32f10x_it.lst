N  * @version V3.5.0
N  * @date    11-March-2011
N  * @brief   CMSIS Cortex-M3 Device Peripheral Access Layer Header File. 
N  *          This file contains all the peripheral register's definitions, bits 
N  *          definitions and memory mapping for STM32F10x Connectivity line, 
N  *          High density, High density value line, Medium density, 
N  *          Medium density Value line, Low density, Low density Value line 
N  *          and XL-density devices.
N  *
N  *          The file is the unique include file that the application programmer
N  *          is using in the C source code, usually in main.c. This file contains:
N  *           - Configuration section that allows to select:
N  *              - The device used in the target application
N  *              - To use or not the peripheral’s drivers in application code(i.e. 
N  *                code will be based on direct access to peripheral’s registers 
N  *                rather than drivers API), this option is controlled by 
N  *                "#define USE_STDPERIPH_DRIVER"
N  *              - To change few application-specific parameters such as the HSE 
N  *                crystal frequency
N  *           - Data structures and the address mapping for all peripherals
N  *           - Peripheral's registers declarations and bits definition
N  *           - Macros to access peripheral’s registers hardware
